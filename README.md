<h1 align="center">Warren</h1>

Warren is a local-first workspace for **durable AI workflows**, organized around **Workspaces** with durable terminal sessions at its core. Run an agent-driven workflow such as Codex or Claude Code on a Host — your Mac or a remote VPS — then reconnect from the macOS desktop, Web/PWA, or CLI after an app quit, network change, or closed laptop. Every client talks to the same Host through one versioned protocol.

## Why Warren

AI workflows are rarely finished in one sitting or on one screen. Warren keeps the
Project, Workspace, Session, and Runtime together on a durable Host, so a workflow
can move from a Mac to the Web or a phone without losing its terminal state or agent
conversation. Use the terminal view when you need raw control and the Agent view when
you want a structured conversation around the same session.

## Highlights

- **Durable sessions** — Sessions belong to the Host, not the client. Detaching, switching workspaces, or quitting the app never ends a running session; closing a Tab is the explicit command to end one.
- **One resource model** — Project → Workspace → Terminal Session → Runtime, shared by every client surface.
- **Local and remote** — The desktop connects to the local `warren-headless` daemon by default, or to `warren-headless` on a VPS. SSH only bootstraps the remote daemon and forwards a port; the same versioned WebSocket API is used everywhere.
- **Real terminal fidelity** — Ghostty on macOS and xterm.js on the Web preserve ANSI, OSC, Unicode, and colors from shells, Codex, Claude, and TUIs.
- **Structured agent views** — Codex and Claude transcripts are projected as normalized events on the Web, so agent sessions can render as a conversation without losing the terminal fallback.
- **Workspace-first Git support** — Projects, main checkouts, and Git worktrees are first-class resources; one-time onboarding can import your existing Superset metadata.
- **Optional central control plane** — The Relay Service provides Host registration, pairing, revocation, and outbound WSS forwarding without storing terminal output or user input.
- **Observability-first acceptance** — Tests use semantic UI snapshots and typed intents: no screenshots, no mouse movement, no focus stealing.

## Current scope

Warren is an early, open-source phase-one project. The desktop client targets macOS 13+ on arm64 Apple Silicon Macs, while the Web/PWA and CLI connect to a local or remote `warren-headless` Host. First-class Agent transcript views currently cover Codex and Claude; other interactive programs remain available through the generic terminal Session interface.

Public Access is an explicit way for the Host owner to reach an existing Web interface from outside the local network. It is not a multi-user Workspace sharing or collaboration feature. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing any Host or Relay to a network.

The current code is licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). This permits commercial use of the present open-source code without implying that Warren currently offers a hosted or enterprise product.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- macOS 13+
- Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode)
- Go 1.25
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for the task runner

Build and run the macOS app:

```sh
mise install
mise run dev
```

`mise run dev` and `mise run package` build arm64 binaries for macOS 13 and
later. macOS app builds require an arm64 Apple Silicon Mac; the headless
daemon and CLI can still be built for non-macOS hosts. Ghostline v1 statically
links its terminal core. The app additionally bundles a short-lived v0.8
compatibility bridge and its arm64 `libghostty-vt.dylib` only for upgrading an
existing v0 session daemon, so no separate Ghostty checkout or architecture
environment variable is required.

The app bundle includes the `warren` CLI. On its first launch Warren installs
it to `~/.local/bin` and adds that directory to the active shell profile when
needed. Use `Tools > Install CLI` to reinstall it manually.

### Embedded editor

The macOS client can show a workspace-scoped VS Code-compatible editor next
to its existing Terminal workflow. Install `code-server` before selecting the
**Editor** button in the top-right workspace actions:

```sh
brew install code-server
```

Warren prewarms code-server and a concealed workspace WebView after a workspace
is selected, then reuses it when the Editor surface opens. The server listens
on a random loopback-only port, uses an isolated profile under
`~/Library/Application Support/Warren/EmbeddedEditor`, and is stopped as a
process group when the local endpoint or app window goes away. After the editor
is ready, Warren installs `golang.go` and `rust-lang.rust-analyzer` in a
background utility task; extension downloads never block the editor from
opening. Existing VS Code and Cursor profiles are not read or modified.

The managed profile uses Warren's Ember colors and a compact editor layout:
the File Explorer lives on the right, while the Activity Bar, title controls,
welcome surfaces, editor action toolbar, minimap, and secondary sidebar stay
hidden. Tabs, breadcrumbs, language diagnostics, the status bar, Quick Open,
the Command Palette, Search, Problems, and diff editors remain available.
Warren refreshes only these managed UI settings on launch and preserves other
valid JSON settings in the isolated profile.

The MVP is available for the Local execution endpoint only. Set
`WARREN_CODE_SERVER_PATH` to an explicit executable when `code-server` is not
on the app's `PATH`. Remote Host integration requires a Host-owned editor
service and is not part of this version.

### Raycast integration

The repository includes a Raycast extension whose command is named **Terminal**.
Search for `terminal` in Raycast to open a new Warren shell; the command
defaults to the `Inbox` terminal group and can be changed in its preferences.
For local development or installation from this checkout:

```sh
cd Support/Raycast
npm install
npm run dev
```

The extension is intentionally kept as a separate package so future Warren
actions can be added as additional Raycast commands without changing the
desktop app.

#### Script Command fallback

Warren registers the `warren://terminal?group=Inbox` URL for external
launchers. Release app bundles include an optional Raycast Script Command and
its Warren icon, but Warren does not install either file or modify Raycast
settings automatically.

After installing Warren at `/Applications/Warren.app`, install the launcher
for the current user:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.warren"
install -m 755 \
  "/Applications/Warren.app/Contents/Resources/warren-terminal.sh" \
  "$HOME/.warren/warren-terminal.sh"
install -m 644 \
  "/Applications/Warren.app/Contents/Resources/warren-terminal.png" \
  "$HOME/.warren/warren-terminal.png"
```

Then open Raycast **Settings → Script Commands → Add Script Directory**, add
`~/.warren`, and search for **Terminal**. The command can be given the
alias `terminal` or a global hotkey from Raycast's **Configure Command** menu.

When working from a source checkout, use the same commands with
`Support/Raycast/warren-terminal.sh` and `Assets/Brand/warren-app-icon.png` as
the two source paths.

### Settings links

Warren also accepts `warren://settings` links. Each Settings section has a
stable `section` value, for example:

```text
warren://settings?section=public-access
```

The Public Access **Copy setup link** action can include the Edge URL, account
name, and the selected Invite Key or Approval Key so another Warren Desktop can
open the right page with the setup fields prefilled:

```text
warren://settings?section=public-access&edgeUrl=<EDGE_URL>&accountName=<ACCOUNT>&keyKind=invite&inviteKey=<SECRET>
```

Because this link contains the bootstrap secret, treat it like a credential.
Browser history, chat systems, and macOS LaunchServices may retain it; share it
only with the intended developer and rotate the key in gnar when it is no
longer needed.

Warren checks GitHub Releases in the background at launch, no more than once
every three hours. When a newer
macOS app is available, a banner below the workspace tabs offers to download
and install it; the Warren application menu always performs a fresh check.

Build the headless daemon and CLI:

```sh
mise run build:headless
```

Run the Web client in development:

```sh
mise run web:dev
```

Try the one-command local Relay experience:

```sh
mise run relay:dev
```
